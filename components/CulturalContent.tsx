          Every trend fades. Culture doesn’t. At Akarsa, we help brands move beyond
          marketing — into culture. Because in the long run, what scales is meaning.

        <p className="service-detail-paragraph">
          Cultural strategy isn’t about following what’s viral — it’s about understanding
          why people believe, buy, and belong. We study values, aesthetics, movements,
          and signals, then translate them into brand actions that resonate deeply.

        <h3 className="service-detail-section-title">Our Approach</h3>
        <p className="service-detail-paragraph">
          We listen more than we speak. We observe more than we sell. We use anthropology,
          semiotics, and design to create cultural resonance. Our 4-layer model: Decode → Define → Design → Distribute.

        <h3 className="service-detail-section-title">Why It Matters</h3>
        <p className="service-detail-paragraph">
          Brands that understand culture shape markets. From memes to movements, culture
          is the operating system of attention. We help you find meaningful space in that ecosystem.
